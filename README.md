A Bucket List CRUD Application. 

This project is hosted on Netlify. Link: https://bucket-list-crud.netlify.app/

<h3>Description</h3>

This was created to learn and understand how CRUD applications work. I decided to make this a bucket list since to do lists are already so popular. This app allows you to create new items to add to your bucket list and then edit or delete those items.

<h3>How It's Made:</h3>

This Project was created with: 
<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>SASS/CSS</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>

<h3>Optimizations</h3>

I would love to fix a lot of the styling and make adjustments to the responsiveness of the site. This was built to learn mostly so I did not spend to much time on the styling. I originally used a hand-written font to give the impression that this app was an actual bucketlist but I personally just didn't like how it turned out after I actually made it.

<h3>What I Learned</h3>

Through creating this project I learned about CRUD apps and how they worked. This app also really pushed me into using a lot of JavaScript because most apps I created get very focused on the CSS above everything else. I enjoyed learning this and it felt very rewarding once I got everything functioning correctly.
